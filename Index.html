        Around <a href= "https://mandmpestcontrol.com/there-are-now-3-million-rats-in-new-york-city-study/">3 million rats</a> inhabit New York City. Recently, Mayor Eric Adams's "War on Rats" campaign intensified the media spotlight on rats. Certain neighborhoods across the boroughs have a more prominent presence of rodents.

  <p>New York City Rats are of the <a href= "https://rattrapinc.com/new-york-city-rat-facts/#:~:text=New%20York%20City%20rats%20like,from%20where%20they%20are%20born">"Norway rat (brown rat) species"</a>. It's one of the most common species of rats. The average brown rat is 16 inches long and weighs around one pound. Rats in New York City only need one ounce of food and water a day to survive.</p>

    <p>Rats seek locations to live that provide what they need to survive: food, water, and shelter. Rats are attracted to heavily populated areas as they have much larger trash output. Garbage is a huge source of food for rats. According to the <a href= "https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/pests/rats.htm">New York City Department of Health</a>, to combat rats moving into trash cans, members of New York City should place "trash in covered metal or heavy-duty plastic trash containers."</p>

<p> It is easy for rats to find shelter in the city, as there are many locations to create borrows. Some rats burrow around trees in the dirt. Building owners should rat-proof locations by removing <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/pests/rats.htm">appliances, junk, old fences, and repairing walls</a>. Landlords must <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/pests/rats.htm">seal</a> any holes that may allow rats to enter their residential buildings.</p>

      <p>Infestations pose a health risk for NYC residents. Rats can carry <a href= "https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/pests/rats.htm">pathogens</a> that can cause an illness, especially in young children. Apart from the pathogens, they have Ectoparasites (ex, lice). Rats can spread disease to people or pets who come into contact with rats'<a href= "https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/pests/rats.htm"> bodily substances like saliva and fecal droppings.</a></p>

 <p>NYC has proposed and signed various initiatives to combat the rat issue. Most recently, on <a href= "https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/761-23/mayor-adams-dsny-commissioner-tisch-open-new-front-war-rats-strategy-containerize#/0">October 11th, 2023</a>, Mayor Adams and his administration unveiled their plan to containerize all trash in residential buildings. Starting in the fall of 2023, "buildings with nine or fewer residential units will be required to place all trash in secure containers," states <a href= "https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/761-23/mayor-adams-dsny-commissioner-tisch-open-new-front-war-rats-strategy-containerize#/0">nyc.gov</a>.
